What is Normalization

Floating point numbers are usually normalized
Exponent is adjusted so that leading bit (MSB) of mantissa is 1
Since it is always 1 there is no need to store it
Scientific notation where numbers are normalized to give a single digit before the decimal point like in.
For example, we represent 3.625 in 32 bit format.
