Trigger and how to create a trigger

a trigger is a set of instructions that is automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular table.
 These events typically include data manipulation operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or a combination of these.

The basic syntax to create a trigger in SQL is as follows:

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW]
BEGIN
    --  actions
END;
