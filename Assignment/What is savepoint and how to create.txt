What is savepoint and how to create a save point

In SQL, a savepoint is a point within a transaction to which you can roll back if needed. 
Here's a simple example:

START TRANSACTION; -- Begin the transaction

-- SQL statements
insert into employees (employee_id, employee_name) values (1, 'John');
SAVEPOINT before_update;

update employees SET employee_name = 'Jane' where employee_id = 1;

-- If something goes wrong, you can roll back to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO before_update;

-- Additional SQL statements within the transaction
insert into departments (department_id, department_name) values (101, 'IT');

-- If everything is okay, commit the transaction
COMMIT;
